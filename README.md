## Overview
This lab was about learning to work with the linked list data structure, this invlved writing methods and testing those methods. We also were tasked with calculating Big O.

* The ```removeLastNode()``` method removes the last node of the list.


* The ```remove(value)``` method removes a node that has the value that matches the value entered.

## Big O:
```removeLastNode()```

* Big O = O(n) n = number of Nodes


```insertAtTail(value)```
* Big O = O(1)

```insertAtHead(value)```
* Big O = O(1)

```remove(value)```
* Big O = O(n) n = number of Nodes
## Getting Started
* Fork GitHub repo
* Clone repo to your local machine
* Enter ```npm i``` in your terminal
* Create lib, assets, and __test__ directories and files. 
* Enter ```npm run test``` in your terminal and watch for green

## Architecture
* JavaScript
* Node.js
* ESLint
* Jest
